Polymorphism:
one item or same item used for different purpose.

TYPES:
1.Overloading
a.Operator overloading
b.Method overloading
2.Overriding

Operator overloading:The "+" operator used for integer addition as well as string concationation.
Method overloading:add() method is used to take 1 more agruments in the same program.

Overriding:if a method is defective or cannot be used inside derived class it take froms its parent class.



                                                           DATA STRUCTURES IN PYTHON

->Helps to write efficient programs.
->linear-array,linked list,stack,queue,matrix.
->non linear-binary tree,heap,hash table,graph.
->Linear is used to store data sequentially.
->Non Linear is used to store non sequential data.

STATIC->ARRAY(size is fixed).
DYNAMIC->LIST,STACK,QUEUE(size is mutable).

LINKED LIST:real time example train.

As the name says list of items which are linked with one another is called as linked list.

TYPES:
1.SINGLY LL
2.DOUBLY LL
3.CIRCULAR LL

CREATING LINKED LIST:

STEP1:create the node.
STEP2:partision the node with 2 segments data and none.
STEP3:add value into the blank node.
STEP4:mark the node as head.
STEP5:create the next node by following the above steps.
STEP6:establish link between the first and the second node.

DISPLAY LINKED LIST:

Traversal is required from first node till tail node in order to display existing linked list.
