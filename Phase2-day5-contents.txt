BINARY TREE:A node can have maximum of two children.

BINARY TREE TRAVERSAL TYPES:

1.inorder->left-root-right(l-d-r)
2.preorder->root-left-right(d-l-r)
3.postorder->left-right-root(l-r-d)data=root

TYPES OF BINARY TREE:
1.Full binary tree-all nodes will have 2 0r 0 children
2.Degenerate tree:every node will have 0 or 1 child
3.Skewed binary tree

   /                                 \
  b                                   b
 /                                     \
c                                       c

left skew binary tree                  right skew binary tree

COMPELE BINARY TREE:

1.every level should be full
2.in last level if it is incompelete notes should present at extreme left side.

PREFECT BINARY TREE:
-all internal nodes those who have 2 children  and a leaf node should be at same level.

BALANCED BINARY TREE:
 - for all nodes height of left subtree-height of right subtree can be 0 or 1 then it is called as balanced tree.

                                 0(d=0)                                   0(d=2)

                          (d=0)1   2(d=0)                          (d=1)1  2(d=0)

BINARY SEARCH TREE:all the left side elements should be lesser than it's parent.
all the right side elements should be greater then it's parent.
